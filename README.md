# Predicting-Sex-Patterns-in-ADHD
Unraveling the Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD

Neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in development, like anxiety, depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, often differ in how and to what extent they affect males and females. ADHD occurs in about 11% of adolescents, with around 14% of boys and 8% of girls having a diagnosis. There is some evidence that girls with ADHD can often go undiagnosed, as they tend to have more inattentive symptoms which are harder to detect. Girls with ADHD who are undiagnosed will continue suffering with symptoms that burden their mental health and capacity to function. The question explored in this project is “What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?” The task is to create a multi-outcome model to predict two separate target variables: 1) ADHD (1=yes or 0=no) and 2) female (1=yes or 0=no).
